To Install:

Unzip package to designated folder.
Copy folders
- Fonts
- Icons
- Mods
- Source
- Textures

into the Pinco'sUI folders.  Allow the new files to overwrite the current files.

Notes:

- This is a skin developed to be an EC version of the UI theme used in the Third Dawn client and uses many of the textures from that client.
- Due to the nature of the theme, the grid backgrounds for "grid view" containers have been removed to replicate the look and feel of the Third Dawn resizeable containers as well as the freeform look and feel of the Legacy Containers.  
- For best results use the non-legacy containers or "Legacy Grid View" settings.
- Third Dawn themed Icons are limited to the basic EC icon set.  Expanded icons retain their default Pinco's UI look.
