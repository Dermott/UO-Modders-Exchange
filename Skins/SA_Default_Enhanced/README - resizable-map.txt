"resizable-map" - by Dar & Zared
Custom UI for use with Ultima Online Stygian Abyss


Release 1.1
	Added the ability to hide facet info


This is included in the dar-zared & dar-zared-blue but I guess people want it by itself.

To add to any Custom UI just copy the 2 files to the source directory of your favorite UI

IE C:\Program Files\electronic Arts\Ultima Online Stygian Abyss\UserInterface\*MY FAVORITE UI*\Source



Please let me know if you have any suggestions for improvement.
